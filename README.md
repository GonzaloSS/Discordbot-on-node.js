# DISCORD BOT ON NODE.JS

    This node.js is a typescript bot, with this bot you can send text to your discord server.

## How works

This discord bot use a token to use this bot on the node.js. then we can configure the bot easily.

### How I add text in my discord bot

You have a lot of choices to add messages into your bot

On this bot I only use two options:

    -message.channel.send

    -message.reply

## How you can make a lot of commands to your bot

I made a config.json to use a static prefix 

My default prefix is "!", you can change it on the config.json
